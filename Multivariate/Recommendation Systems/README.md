# Recommendation Systems
**Recommendation systems** predicte user responses to options. [Long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) phenomenon makes recommendation systems necessary.

We can classify these systems into two broad groups:
- Content-based systems: examine properties of the items recommended
- Collaborative-filtering systems: recommend items based on similarity measures between users and/or items
