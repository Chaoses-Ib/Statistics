# Feature Engineering
[^wiki]

Feature engineering (feature extraction) is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process.

## Process
The feature engineering process is:
- Brainstorming or testing features
- Deciding what features to create
- Creating features
- Testing the impact of the identified features on the task
- Improving your features if needed
- Repeat

## Typical engineered features
The following list provides some typical ways to engineer useful features:
- Numerical transformations (like taking fractions or scaling)
- Category encoder like one-hot or target encoder (for categorical data)
- Clustering
- Group aggregated values
- Principal component analysis (for numerical data)
