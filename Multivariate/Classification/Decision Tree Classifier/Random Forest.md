# Random Forest
[^wiki]

**Random forests (or random decision forests)** is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. Random forests generally outperform decision trees, but their accuracy is lower than gradient boosted trees.
