# Classification
In general, we may think of the classifier as a model or function M that predicts the class label $\hat{y}$ for a given input example $x$:

$$\hat{y}=M(x)$$

where $x=(x_1,x_2,...,x_d)^T \in R^d$ is a point in $d$-dimensional space and $\hat{y}\in \{c_1,c_2,...,c_k\}$ in its predicated class.
