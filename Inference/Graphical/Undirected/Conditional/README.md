# Conditional Random Fields
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field)

**Conditional random fields** is one notable variant of Markov random fields, in which each random variable may also be conditioned upon a set of global observations $o$. In this model, each function 
$\phi _{k}$ is a mapping from all assignments to both the clique $k$ and the observations  $o$ to the nonnegative real numbers. This form of the Markov network may be more appropriate for producing discriminative classifiers, which do not model the distribution over the observations.[^markov-wiki]
