# Statistical Inference
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference)

**Statistical inference** is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability. **Inferential statistics** can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

In machine learning, the term _inference_ is sometimes used instead to mean "make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model"; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as _training_ or _learning_ (rather than _inference_), and using a model for prediction is referred to as _inference_ (instead of _prediction_); see also [predictive inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference "Predictive inference").

## Statistical models
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model)

A **statistical model** is a mathematical model that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data (and similar data from a larger population).
