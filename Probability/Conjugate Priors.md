# Conjugate Priors
A **prior probability distribution (the prior)** of an uncertain quantity is the probability distribution that would express one's beliefs about this quantity before some evidence is taken into account.[^wiki-prior] A **posterior probability distribution** is the probability distribution that results from updating the prior probability distribution with information summarized by the likelihood, through an application of [Bayes' theorem](Bayes'%20Theorem.md).[^wiki-posterior]

If the posterior probability distribution $p(\theta \mid x)$ is in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution $p(\theta )$, the prior and posterior are then called **conjugate distributions**, and the prior is called a **conjugate prior** for the likelihood function $p(x\mid \theta )$.[^wiki]
